# Create a method called sum_these_numbers which takes two integers as an argument and prints their sum to the screen.

# def sum_these_numbers (num1, num2)
#     num1 + num2
# end
# p sum_these_numbers(3 , 4)
# output: 7
# Create a method called is_even, which takes a single integer, and which then returns true if the number is even, and false otherwise.
# def is_even  number
#     if number % 2 == 0
#         puts "#{number} is Even"
#     else
#         puts "#{number} is Odd"
#     end
# end

# Create a method that takes a number as an argument and prints "Valid" if the number is between 1 and 10 (inclusive) and "Invalid" otherwise.
